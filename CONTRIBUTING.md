# Contribution Guidelines
awesome-AutoHotkey is a specially curated list for high-quality, AutoHotkey libraries, library distributions, scripts, tools and resources.
This resource was made by the AutoHotkey community and wouldn't be possible without you! We appreciate and recognize [all contributors](https://github.com/ahkscript/awesome-AutoHotkey/graphs/contributors).


###How to contribute item
Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
- Please contribute items you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.
- If you have rights to commit to the list (member of ahkscript organization) then edit list directly, no need for pull request. If you are not member of ahkscript organization, make an individual pull request for each item.
- Chose corresponding group (Libraries, Library Distributions, Scripts or Tools or Resources) and subgroup for your item.
- Subgroups and list items should be sorted *alphabetically*. Exeptions are:
  1. In group **Tools**, subgroup *Interpreter* comes first.
  3. In group **Resources**, in subgroups *Websites*, *Documentation* and *Quick-start guides*, official ones comes first. 
- Each item should follow rules:
 1. First comes the name of the item which in the same time is a link to home page. If there is no home page, the link of official AutoHotkey forum thread (http://ahkscript.org/boards/) of that item. If item has not any of these links then any link you think is most significant for item. 
 2. After should go `-` sign. 
 3. After should go short, clear, concise, and non-promotional description. Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line.
 4. If the item has any other related links, they should go after description. Like this - Forum thread: [link](http://link) .
- Use unique anchor tags for each item in the table of contents (more about it [here](https://github.com/ahkscript/awesome-AutoHotkey/issues/12)).

### Quality standards
To stay on the list, libraries, library distributions, scripts, tools and resource should adhere to these quality standards:
- Generally useful to the community.
- Functional.
- Stable, or progressing toward stable.
